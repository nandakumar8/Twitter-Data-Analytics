# Twitter-Data-Analytics

The twitter data analytics is an R- Code sample for analyzing a huge dataset and creating two-dimensional graphs. The dataset contains dirty data which can be ignored.

•	In the second plot, I'm finding the number of users with above and below 1000 followers in three major cities.
